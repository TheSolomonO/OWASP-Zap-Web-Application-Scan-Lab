# OWASP-Zap-Web-Application-Scan-Lab

## Objective

The OWASP Zap project aimed to scan and identify vulnerabilities in a web application hosted on a Metasploitable machine. The primary focus was to detect potential security flaws, such as injection attacks and cross-site scripting, and generate reports on the findings. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of web application security, vulnerability scanning, and exploitation techniques.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using OWASP Zap for web application vulnerability scanning.
- Ability to identify and analyze common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Familiarity with scanning techniques and report generation for vulnerability assessment.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in identifying and mitigating web application security threats.

### Tools Used

- Kali Linux virtual machine for running security tools and managing the environment.
- OWASP Zap for performing web application vulnerability scanning and analysis.
- Metasploitable machine as a vulnerable target for testing and scanning.

## Steps

- I started by installing the owasp-zap too into my Kali Linux machine.

- I then started my metasplooitable machine and Im going to run the web application security scan against it. Here I found the IP address of Metasploitable.

- I then choose to run an automated scan and started the attack against the Metasploitable machine.

- Here the scan completed and I received 3 different Alerts.
